### Hooks

Before and after hooks are provided for CRUD operations and resource lifecycle
events. Certain hooks, such as "before create" are asynchronous and execute in
series. Others such as "after update" are synchronous and run in parallel.

```javascript
User.before('create', function (resource, changed, next) {
  // do something before save such as validation and then call next()
});

User.after('update', function (resource, changed) {
  // do something after update
});
```

Events prefixed with `before` are asynchronous hooks and run in series.
Asynchronous hooks receive a `next` function as the last argument, which must
be called to continue firing subsequent listeners. Arguments received by
`next` are passed to the callback of the method that fired the event. If the
first argument received by `next` is an error subsequent hooks will not be run.
Similarly for find and count events, if the second argument received by next
is non-null subsequent hooks will not be run.
